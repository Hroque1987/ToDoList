Node.js ToDoList

Here is a ToDO List made as an small project from the Udemy course " The complete 2021 Web Developement Bootcamp", i will leave the link at the bottom.

In this ToDo List we used Node.js with some NPM packages, such as: Express, EJS, Body Parser, Lodash and Mongoose.
As you might notice the list is completed with Mongo DB, in this example the Atlas version.

You can check out the list at : https://shrouded-castle-39837.herokuapp.com/

And the course : https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gG2@FG1gbF1aSFMGcUVAOEtn/ ( I strongly recommend this course as a beginner).
